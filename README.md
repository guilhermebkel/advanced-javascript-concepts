## How the browser understands javascript code

As most known, javascript is a interpreted language, so it is not compiled into machine language before going to production.

What really happens is that there is a **Engine** which is capable of making some work to make the javascript code to be compiled to machine code during its execution and so interpreted by processor dynamically.

Every browser has its own engine, today the most famous is called **V8 Engine** and it is used by Google Chrome and new versions of Internet Explorer.

Below you can see the steps followed by the **Engine** in order to make the javascript code interpretable by computer:

- ```Parser```
	- The javascript code is parsed based on its syntax (variable declarations, function declarations, etc) into a **AST - Abstract Syntax Tree** (it is basically a JSON of the code formated into a tree).

After the step above, the following ones happen at the same time:

- ```Interpreter```
	- Turns the **AST** into **Bytecode** (not a machine code, but executable with engine help) that gets executed by the computer on the fly (it is a work around to make the code to be executed as fast as possible by the browser, since it is not actually optimized and a real machine code but is executable anyway).

- ```Compiler```
	- While the **Interpreter** is running, it makes optimizations on the created **Bytecode**. After making the needed optimizations, it replaces the **old non-optimized Bytecode** with the new changes.

So, with the steps above (called JIT Compiler - Just In Time Compiler), the code gets executed on the fly while making needed optimizations to improve the application speed.

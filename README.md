## How the browser understands javascript code

As most known, javascript is a interpreted language, so it is not compiled into machine language before going to production.

What really happens is that there is a **Engine** which is capable of making some work to make the javascript code to be interpreted by machine language dynamically.

Every browser has its own engine, today the most famous is called **V8 Engine** and it is used by Google Chrome and new versions of Internet Explorer.
